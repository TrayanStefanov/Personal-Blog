                        between.

                        Whether it’s exploring new tech, diving into creative projects, or just enjoying the simple

                        with

                        When I’m not out exploring nature, I’m probably deep in code — turning ideas
                        into digital tools that make life a little easier. Programming has always been more than just
                        logic
                        and
                        syntax for me — it’s a creative outlet, a problem-solving mindset, and honestly, kind of

                        I’m especially into web development and mobile apps — creating things that are not only

                        but
                        actually help in day-to-day life. Whether it’s a small script that saves time, a full-blown app,
                        or
                        just
                        a random experiment that turns into something useful, this space is where I share that side of

                            <h6>The Hike Itself</h6>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">The journey usually starts from the lift at
                                Panichishte, which takes you up to the Rila Lakes Hut. From there, the trail climbs
                                gradually, passing each lake one by one. You can do the hike as a loop, and there
                                are
                                several options depending on your pace and the views you’re after.</p>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">I recommend starting early — not just to beat
                                the
                                crowds, but because watching the morning sun hit the lakes is something else. The
                                colors
                                shift with the light, the reflection of the peaks on the still water is unreal, and
                                every
                                step upward rewards you with an even more breathtaking view.</p>
                            <h6>What Makes It Special?</h6>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">For me, it’s not just the landscape — although
                                that’s
                                clearly a huge part. It’s the feeling you get being there. The calm. The space. The
                                reminder
                                of how small we are in the best possible way.</p>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">There's also something deeply spiritual about
                                the
                                place. It’s sacred to the White Brotherhood, a spiritual movement that gathers there
                                every
                                August for rituals, music, and dancing. Even if you're not part of that tradition,
                                the
                                energy up there feels special.</p>
                            <h6>Tips for the Trail:</h6>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">
                            <ol>
                                <li>Wear proper hiking boots — some parts of the trail are rocky and uneven.</li>
                                <li>Bring layers — even in summer, the weather can shift quickly.</li>
                                <li>Pack water and snacks — there are a few huts, but always good to be prepared.
                                </li>
                                <li>Take your time — it’s not about rushing to the top, it’s about soaking it all
                                    in.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h6> Final Thoughts</h6>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">The Seven Rila Lakes aren’t just a hike —
                                they’re
                                an
                                experience. Whether you go for the adventure, the scenery, or just to unplug for a
                                while,
                                this place delivers. It’s one of those trails that reminds you why you fell in love
                                with
                                the
                                outdoors in the first place.</p>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">And trust me — once you've stood by Salzata and
                                looked
                                out over the whole valley, you'll understand why people return again and again.</p>

                                If you're looking for a quick yet breathtaking escape from the hustle of Sofia, Kamen
                                Del Peak should be at the top of your list—literally and figuratively. Tucked into the
                                northern slopes of Vitosha Mountain, this rocky summit offers some of the most stunning
                                panoramic views over the Bulgarian capital. Whether you're a local looking to rediscover
                                your backyard or a traveler craving a nature fix without straying far from the city,

                                Kamen Del (meaning “Stone Piece” in Bulgarian) might not be the highest peak on Vitosha
                                (that title goes to Cherni Vrah), but it’s arguably one of the most rewarding hikes for
                                minimal effort. Standing at 1,862 meters, the peak reveals a jaw-dropping view of Sofia,

                                camera—the views stretch out over Sofia, the Balkan Mountains to the north, and even the
                                distant ridges of Rila on a clear day. It’s also a great spot for drone shots or a
                                peaceful moment away from it all.</p>
                            <p class="text-break my-3 fw-light fs-5">I recommend starting early — not just to beat
                                the
                                crowds, but because watching the morning sun hit the lakes is something else. The
                                colors
                                shift with the light, the reflection of the peaks on the still water is unreal, and
                                every
                                step upward rewards you with an even more breathtaking view.</p>

                                <li><strong>Best time to go</strong>: Late spring through early autumn offers the best
                                    weather and clearest views. That said, winter snowshoe hikes up here are magical
                                    too.</li>
                                <li><strong>Watch the wind</strong>: Kamen Del is quite exposed, so bring a
                                    windbreaker—even in summer.</li>
                                <li><strong>Sunset chasers</strong>: This is one of the best spots on Vitosha to watch
                                    the sun set over Sofia. Just remember to bring a headlamp for the hike down.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wildlife</strong>: Keep your eyes open for hawks and the occasional mountain
                                    goat in quieter months.</li>
                            </ul>

                    When I’m not out exploring nature, I’m probably deep in code — turning ideas
                    into digital tools that make life a little easier. Programming has always been more than just
                    logic
                    and
                    syntax for me — it’s a creative outlet, a problem-solving mindset, and honestly, kind of
                    addictive

                        <p>The world of software development is undergoing a transformation — and artificial
                            intelligence
                            (AI) is at the heart of it. What once required hours of manual labor can now be assisted,
                            accelerated, or even automated by AI-powered tools. But what does this actually mean for
                            developers on the ground? Let's take a closer look.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">Smarter Code Suggestions</h4>
                        <p>AI-powered code completion tools like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Tabnine are
                            revolutionizing the way we write code. By analyzing massive codebases and learning from
                            them,
                            these tools can now suggest entire lines or blocks of code as you type — not just individual
                            syntax snippets.Developers report a boost in productivity and a significant reduction in
                            boilerplate code. While these tools aren’t perfect, they help bridge knowledge gaps and can
                            offer solutions that a human might overlook.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">Automated Testing and QA</h4>
                        <p>Testing is a critical part of development, and AI is making this process smarter and faster.
                            Tools like Diffblue Cover and Testim can automatically generate unit tests or perform
                            end-to-end
                            testing using machine learning to simulate real-world user behavior.
                            AI-enhanced QA means fewer bugs slipping into production, and less manual effort spent
                            writing
                            exhaustive test cases.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">Intelligent Debugging</h4>
                        <p>Debugging has long been a time-consuming chore. But with AI’s ability to analyze logs,
                            monitor
                            application performance, and learn patterns of failure, we're now seeing tools that
                            proactively
                            detect and even suggest fixes for bugs. Microsoft’s IntelliCode and startup solutions like
                            Rookout are early examples.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">A Future of Human-AI Collaboration</h4>
                        <p>Rather than replacing developers, AI is becoming a coding companion. The future will likely
                            see
                            AI and human developers working side-by-side — the human guiding creativity and logic, and
                            the
                            AI speeding up repetitive or complex tasks.
                            The key will be learning how to harness these tools wisely, understanding their limitations,
                            and
                            continuing to develop a deep understanding of software architecture and problem-solving.</p>

                            and
                            algorithms. But if we strip it all down to its core, the true purpose of technology has
                            always
                            been simple: to make life easier.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">What Do We Really Mean by "Easier"?</h4>
                        <p>“Easier” doesn’t just mean faster or more convenient — though those are key benefits. It
                            means
                            reducing human effort, solving complex problems, connecting people across distances, and
                            enhancing our ability to live, work, and thrive. From the wheel to the smartphone, every
                            major
                            invention has aimed to improve the human experience.</p>

                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Smartphones have become an extension of ourselves — calendars, cameras, GPS devices,
                                entertainment centers, and communication tools all rolled into one.</li>
                            <li>Voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant help us multitask and get things
                                done hands-free.</li>
                            <li>Online banking and digital payments have eliminated the need for long queues and paper
                                checks.</li>
                            <li>Wearable tech like smartwatches and fitness trackers help us monitor our health in real
                                time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        These aren’t just luxuries anymore. For many, they’re essential tools that simplify daily
                        routines.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">Technology as a Global Equalizer</h4>
                        <p>
                            While it’s not perfect, technology has the power to level the playing field:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remote work and learning allow people to access jobs and education from anywhere.</li>

                            <li>Translation apps break language barriers and open up global communication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        These tools empower individuals regardless of geography, background, or income — pushing us
                        toward a
                        more connected and inclusive world.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">The Rise of Automation and AI</h4>
                        <p>One of the most exciting frontiers in tech is automation. AI-driven systems are now handling
                            everything from sorting emails to diagnosing medical conditions. While some fear job
                            displacement, automation can also free us from repetitive, time-consuming tasks — giving
                            people
                            more time to focus on creative, meaningful, and impactful work.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">But Here’s the Catch: Purpose-Driven Tech</h4>
                        <p>As we continue to innovate, it’s important to ask: Is this technology truly serving us? Not
                            all
                            tech makes life easier. Some can complicate it — through distractions, privacy risks, or
                            dependency. That’s why human-centered design and ethical innovation are so important.
                            Technology
                            should work with us, not against us.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">In Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Technology, at its best, is a tool for good — a bridge between problems and solutions.
                            Whether
                            it’s saving us time, expanding our access to knowledge, or connecting us with loved ones
                            around
                            the globe, its purpose remains clear: to make life easier, better, and more fulfilling.

                            The future isn’t just about smarter tech — it’s about using that tech smartly.</p>

                        <p>Life in the 21st century is nothing if not full. From the moment we wake up, we’re bombarded
                            with choices — what to eat, what to wear, what to work on, what to post, who to reply to,
                            which tab to close, what to buy, and when to unplug (if ever).

                            It’s no exaggeration to say we make hundreds, if not thousands of decisions every day — far
                            more than our ancestors ever did. And while progress has brought us convenience, it’s also
                            come with a price: decision fatigue and mental overload.

                            That’s where lifestyle apps come in — quiet heroes in our chaotic lives, subtly reducing the
                            cognitive clutter so we can focus on what matters.</p>
                        <h4 class="display-6"> Decision Fatigue: The Hidden Drain on Our Mental Energy</h4>
                        <p>Studies show that the human brain has a limited capacity for quality decision-making in a
                            day. The more choices we face — even small ones — the more our focus, willpower, and
                            emotional bandwidth get depleted. That’s why people like Steve Jobs wore the same outfit
                            every day — one less decision to make.

                            Now, multiply that mental load by modern life:</p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dozens of open browser tabs.</li>
                            <li>Constant app notifications.</li>
                            <li>Multiple group chats.</li>
                            <li>Calendar alerts.</li>
                            <li>Streaming choices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Even choosing lunch can feel overwhelming.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">How Lifestyle Apps Lighten the Load</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="fw-bold"> How Lifestyle Apps Lighten the Load </li>
                            Lifestyle apps, when used intentionally, act like digital assistants — not replacing our
                            choices, but streamlining them.
                            <li class="fw-bold"> Smart Calendars & Task Managers</li>
                            Apps like Google Calendar, Todoist, and Notion help us externalize memory — so we don’t have
                            to mentally juggle appointments, meetings, and goals.
                            <li class="fw-bold"> Meal Planners & Grocery Lists</li>
                            Tools like Mealime or Yummly take the stress out of daily food decisions. You pick your
                            goals, and the app handles the rest.
                            <li class="fw-bold">Wellness & Mindfulness Apps</li>
                            Headspace, Calm, and Balance don’t just help you relax — they remind you to take a break,
                            breathe, and reflect, acting as your personal mental health allies.
                            <li class="fw-bold">Wardrobe & Style Helpers</li>
                            Virtual closet apps like Stylebook help you plan outfits in advance, reduce clothing
                            clutter, and avoid the dreaded “what should I wear?” moment each morning.
                            <li class="fw-bold">Budgeting & Finance Tools</li>
                            Apps like YNAB or Mint don’t just track your spending — they automate the boring parts of
                            money management, freeing up energy for bigger financial decisions.
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="display-6">Tech for Balance, Not Dependence</h4>
                        <p>
                            Here’s the key: Lifestyle apps are here to assist, not control.
                            When used wisely, they act like cognitive offloading tools — freeing up your brain so you
                            can make fewer, but better, decisions.

                            But like any tool, balance matters. Relying too heavily on tech can sometimes dull our
                            natural intuition or make us feel more scattered. The goal isn’t to outsource our entire
                            lives — it’s to use tech to create space for reflection, creativity, and presence.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="display-6">Final Thought</h4>
                        <p>
                            In a world where we’re asked to think, choose, and react faster than ever before, lifestyle
                            apps are more than just digital conveniences. They’re modern coping tools — helping us
                            manage the invisible weight of decision overload.

                            We don’t need to live like machines.
                            We just need smarter tools to help us live like humans — with more peace, clarity, and
                            intention.

                        Beat one egg with 200 ml of water in a mixing bowl. Gradually add flour until the batter reaches
                        the right consistency. Tip: For me, it’s ready when the batter starts leaving visible trails
                        when stirred with a fork. Heat a non-stick pan and add one drop of oil before pouring in the
                        batter for each pancake. Cook each pancake for about 1 minute on the first side, then flip.
                        Total cooking time: about 2 minutes per pancake. One egg yields approximately 5 pancakes.

                                500 g filo pastry (banitsa sheets), 300 g yogurt, 5 eggs, 400 g feta cheese (or

                        Beat the eggs in a bowl. In a separate bowl, dissolve the baking soda in the warm yogurt, then
                        add this mixture to the beaten eggs. Stir well. Crumble the feta cheese into large pieces. For
                        each sheet of filo pastry, brush lightly with melted butter, then spread a little of the egg and
                        yogurt mixture over the top. Sprinkle some of the crumbled cheese on the pastry. Roll up two
                        sheets of pastry into a spiral and place them in a greased baking dish, forming a circle. Repeat
                        until all the pastry is used. Pour the remaining egg and yogurt mixture over the top of the
                        banitsa. Dot the banitsa with a few small pieces of butter and bake in a preheated oven at 200°C
                        (390°F) for about 35-40 minutes. After baking, dust generously with powdered sugar and lightly
                        sprinkle with cold water. Cover the banitsa and let it sit for 15-20 minutes before serving.
